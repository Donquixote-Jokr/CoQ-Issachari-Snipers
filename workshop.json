  "Description": "This mod adds 1 new creature and a new weapon, The Issachari Sniper is a new and slightly deadlier version of the Issachari Rifler. \n\nEquipped with an Issachar Sniper which does more damage then the base games Sniper Rifle but suffers from worse accuracy and weighs more.\n\nThis is my first mod so please report any issues or bugs you may find and let me know if you feel the Issachar Sniper is too over or underpowered.
